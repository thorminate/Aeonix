You are currently not able to see any channels other than a few for the onboarding process and the non-player-hangout area. These channels are for setting you up, (such as initializing your persona into the database, the persona being your digital presence with Aeonix) we will also go through the skill system and how other important stats work.
  
When you have read through the information, please press the button below, and Aeonix will validate your persona's existence in the database, thereafter giving you the <@&1270791621289578607> role.
